In comparing recovering from three different types of trauma, intentional human produced traumas, unintentional human produced traumas and natural disasters producing traumas, an internationally recognised expert in <a href="/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/" title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder</a> (<a href="/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/" title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</a>), Glenn R. Schiraldi has stated that "<span class="highlight">intentional human traumas</span> are usually the worst, <a href="/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/" title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</a> symptoms resulting from such stressors are usually more complex, are of a longer duration, and are more difficult to treat"<sup>1</sup>

When a person experiences <a href="/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/" title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</a>, their world becomes fearful, they often feel like there is chaos and they have no control. Their views of life, relationships and almost everything else can be challenged. We all know that the world can be unstable. Earthquakes, volcanoes and many other natural events are evident in our mountain ranges and islands. While we hope that we will never be subject to such events, we do acknowledge at some cognitive level that they are natural. We also know that we and others make mistakes. What can be extremely difficult, however, is to see the side of humanity that willingly brings suffering to countless beings. We want to believe that we are better than this. We want to believe that our family and friends are better than this. We want to believe that our government wouldn't sacrifice us on foreign battlefields for economic gain. 

Many come home from conflict and have to suffer with the stress of what they experienced and - on top of this - this can find themselves distrustful of others. When they have seen what human beings can do do one another, moving forward with life can be incredibly difficult. This difficulty is not limited to those who have experienced combat situations, but can also arise from extremely traumatic interpersonal relationships. A person who finds out their partner has suddenly left them, can experience <a href="/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/" title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</a>. A person who has experience domestic violence can experience <a href="/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/" title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</a>. A person who has been raped can experience <a href="/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/" title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</a>. 

Understanding the trauma and how people react to such can often be an early step on the road to recovery. Realising that you are not somehow "odd" for feeling the way you do, can help with the pain. If you think you are experiencing <a href="/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/" title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</a>, there is help available. Contact your GP and share your concerns, talk to someone you can trust, look online and in your local library for resources related to <a href="/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/" title="Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder">PTSD</a> or research the counsellors in your area (or available online).

You can recover from PTSD! Don't feel that you have to suffer alone.
