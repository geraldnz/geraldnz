In this distortion of thinking, <span class="highlight">disqualifying the positive</span>, the individual invalidates or ignores stimuli of a more "positive" nature. This can be by making excuses for positive things - "I didn't deserve this!", "This is just a fluke!" - or it can involve the individual not noticing the occurrence of positive events (usually while focusing heavily on more "negative" events and interpretations).
