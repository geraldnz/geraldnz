<span class="highlight">Should statements</span> are a <a href="/cognitive-distortions/" title="Cognitive Distortions">cognitive distortion</a> where an individual projects his or her expectations upon others and, when others come up lacking (as is often the case), the individual becomes angry, depressed, anxious or otherwise upset. Applying "should" statements over long periods can lead to hostiility towards and disillusionment with others. 

Others do not act according to any standards which we may attempt to apply to them and the use of "should" statements will only lead to difficulties for ourselves. Using therapeutic insights, the individual can begin to move from expecting others to be what we want them to be, to being more accepting of who they actually are.
