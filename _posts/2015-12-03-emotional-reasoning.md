<span class="highlight">Emotional Reasoning</span> involves the imposing of emotions on events (or interpretations) and creating "facts" from overlaying these emotions. When you feel anxious and you decide that there must be reason, chances are that you will be able to create a "reason". Imposing these emotions, rather than attempting to rationally consider the situation means that an individual ends up being controlled by emotional states - which often become increasingly illogical.
