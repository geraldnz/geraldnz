<span class="highlight">Overgeneralisation</span> is a <a href="/cognitive-distortions/" title="Cognitive Distortion">cognitive distortion</a> where an individual makes a "rule" or draws long-term conclusions from a single event, action or piece of "evidence". Reaching conclusions from a single event leaves the individual subject to decision-making that is not only very likely to representative of "reality", but encourages extreme and inflexible decision-making.

If you are not invited to a party and you decide that "no one likes me", you have overgeneralised and not only is your conclusion likely to be false, but it puts you into a negative frame of mind, which can encourage further negative thoughts, isolation and depression. You are then not only in a position not to get the interaction to disprove your original assumption incorrect, you may start to collect additional "evidence" to support your original overgeneralisation.
