<span class="highlight">Personalisation</span> is a <a href="/cognitive-distortions/" title="Cognitive Distortion">cognitive distortion</a> where an individual believes that he or she is responsible for actions or events over which the individual has no direct control. When such things occur, self criticism and other negative self-talk will happen, with resulting effects on mood, perceptions and future events.

When you blame yourself for things out of your control, you assume guilt for something you could not have avoided and you punish yourself unnecessarily. Learning to distinguish actions over which we have control from those over which we do not is an early step in making cognitive corrections to help our state of mind and relationships.
