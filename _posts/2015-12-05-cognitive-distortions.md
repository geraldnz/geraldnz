<span class="highlight">Cognitive distortions</span> are thoughts which are inconsistent with more rational assessments of events, with these thoughts generally developing into more consistent patterns of thinking in an individual. As these thoughts become patterns of mental processing, they begin to shape moods, leading to biases in thinking that encourage anxiety and depression (among other things).

Some approaches to counselling and psychotherapy have developed specific ways to analyse, indentify and then begin to challenge these thoughts, These approaches - including <a href="/cognitive-therapy/" title="Cognitive Therapy">Cognitive (Behavioural) Therapy</a> -  attempt to deconstruct the "negative" thought patterns and provide more realistic assessment tools for the individual.
