blowing the length of the street
howling the depth of the night
calling to those unable to hear
screaming to those unwilling to care
the street

alone they sat along the path
together they huddle in the darkness
without meaning they exist

street
wind
cold
blow
darkness
isolation
humanity
microcosm
compassion
shared
forgotten

They have been forgotten, cast aside.
No longer us, they are less than alive.

Cast aside, waiting to die.

They live their lives in open desperation.

the screaming streets
the neglected wind
the hardened rain
the overcast sorrow
the forgetful time
the blanketed pain

they are us, they are who we fear to be.
while we fear to be them, they are better than us,
they are more honest, they are more noble,
they are more alive

they have not lost their way, it is us who have lost ours.
