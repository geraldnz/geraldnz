What does it mean to be in the "<span class="highlight">here and now</span>" and what does this mean for therapy?

The present moment is the focus of the current "<a href="/mindfulness/" title="Mindfulness">Mindfulness</a>" therapeutic techniques (originating in the Buddhist foundations of these practices), but other approaches to therapy also emphasise the current moment. One example is <a href="/gestalt-therapy/" title="Gestalt Therapy">Gestalt Therapy</a>, which was developed and popularised by <a href="/fritz-perls/" title="Fritz Perls">Fritz Perls</a> . Following is an introductory video to this practice, where <a href="/fritz-perls/" title="Fritz Perls">Fritz</a> explains the significance of the "here and now" for <a href="/gestalt-therapy/" title="Gestalt Therapy">Gestalt Therapy</a>.
