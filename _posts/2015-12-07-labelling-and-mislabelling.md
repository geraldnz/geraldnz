<span class="highlight">Labelling and mislabelling</span> are overgeneralisations where an individual applies a rigid and extreme determination to actions, events or people. If I lose job and then refer to myself as "worthless", this is labelling. If you are late for work and I say that you are lazy and don't care about working, this is mislabelling. 

Both applying harsh labels and the mislabelling of ourselves or others have negative effects on ourselves. As we apply labels, our thinking becomes increasingly inflexible and we find that we alienate others. This makes us even more negative in outlook and the labels and resulting mindset become self-fulfilling prophecies.
